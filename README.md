Here is my technical solution to collect and display travel paths for Yet Another Travel Agency.
This minimalistically designed application comes with two core - and only - features:
 - It allows a user to load a travel path into the database by filling it in a form - or through a POST request under the name "json".
 - It displays the already stored paths one step at a time.

A SQL dump of an empty base is also included to help installing it elsewhere.
In case a reference frame would prove to be needed, it took around three hours to build.
